    Counts the number of potential hairpin structures in a DNA sequence and returns a simple linear
    representation of the hairpins (stem1(loop)stem2_rc), or None if no hairpins are found.

    Parameters:
        sequence (str): The DNA sequence to analyze.
        min_stem (int): Minimum number of bases in the stem for stable hairpin.
        min_loop (int): Minimum number of bases in the loop.

    Returns:
        tuple: (int, str or None)
            - The count of potential hairpin structures.
            - A single string showing the detected hairpins in the format 'stem1(loop)stem2_rc', or None if no hairpins are found.
